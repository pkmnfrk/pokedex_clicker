This is an idle/incremental game about catching them all.

## Features

 * Click the big Poké Ball to catch a Pokémon!
 * Earn money for each Pokémon caught!
 * Trade in sets of Pokémon to boost the value of that species!
 * Hire trainers to help you catch Pokémon!
 * Purchase upgrades to make your trainers more effective!
 * Fill up your Pokédex to unlock a new set of Pokémon!
 * Start in Generation 1 (Red/Blue), and work your way up to Generation 7 (Sun/Moon)!
 * Tablet browser friendly (no zooming on rapid taps)!

## Planned features

 * More upgrades for each trainer
 * An additional prestige layer (clear Gen 7 to earn a badge)
   * Badges would boost earn rate for their type
 * Yet another prestige layer (earn 8 badges + Elite Four to become a Champion)
   * Become champion in all 7 regions
 * Shiny Pokémon! (a random change for a caught Pokémon to be a shiny, which permanently boosts its bonus)
 * Upgrades to make specific Pokémon easier to catch (mythical/legendaries)
